title: 'Catered By Matt'
details: "I developed the website cateredbymatt.com using WordPress and Elementor, delivering a seamless, fully responsive user experience across all devices. Working closely with a designer, I meticulously translated their vision into a pixel-perfect, functional site while maintaining design integrity. Leveraging Elementor's flexibility, I optimized performance, implemented best practices, and ensured every detail reflected the client's brand. This project highlights my ability to collaborate effectively, adhere to creative directions, and deliver high-quality results, making me the ideal partner for your next web development project."
