title: 'Cowboy Channel Plus'
details: "Originally developed in WordPress with Elementor, get.cowboychannelplus.com was designed to showcase live and on-demand content for Cowboy Channel’s streaming service. Due to infrastructure updates and the need for better performance and control over production builds, the project was migrated to a modern HTML/CSS stack using Vite for optimized bundling and deployment.<br /><br />
The site’s primary goal is to promote and sell Cowboy Channel’s streaming subscriptions through engaging, responsive landing pages. Each page is built with clean, maintainable code using modern CSS techniques to ensure an excellent user experience across all devices.<br /><br />
This is an ongoing project, continually evolving as new content and pages are added to enhance functionality and marketing reach."
