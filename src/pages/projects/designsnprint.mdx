title: 'Design n Print'
details: "We developed an innovative custom design tool enabling clients to create personalized designs, catering to users who prioritize bespoke customization over pre-built solutions.<br /><br />The frontend was meticulously crafted using React and custom CSS, ensuring a highly interactive and intuitive user interface. A significant aspect of this development involved the integration and tailored adjustment of third-party modules to seamlessly align with specific project requirements and design specifications.<br /><br />On the backend, Laravel was utilized to provide a robust and scalable foundation. A core feature of the tool is its integration with PDF.js, allowing users to export their finalized designs as high-quality PDF files, which can then be directly used for ordering from the client. This comprehensive solution directly supports the client's business model by empowering customer self-service and streamlining the order fulfillment process."
