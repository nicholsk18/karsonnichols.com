title: 'Hell On Wheels'
details: "This project required the development of a high-impact landing page on a tight deadline. While the timeline was aggressive, the designer wanted to incorporate a fun, standout element, a scroll-triggered animation of a person popping out of a truck, based on a video asset.<br /><br />
To bring this concept to life without delaying delivery or increasing costs, I used ScrollSequence scroll animation plugin that closely matched the desired effect. This eliminated the need for custom animation development while still delivering an engaging user experience.<br /><br />
In addition to meeting the creative and timeline goals, I focused on performance and accessibility. I optimized all images and media for fast load times and implemented responsive design techniques to ensure a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The result is a landing page that not only feels dynamic and fun, but also loads quickly and performs well across all screen sizes.<br /><br />
Built with WordPress, the project showcases how the platform can be leveraged to deliver visually rich and technically complex solutions quickly, without compromising on performance or quality."
